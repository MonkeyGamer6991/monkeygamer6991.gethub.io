                                            <p> Nathan back for another day of learning. So fare I'm doing fine, with a little trouble
                                            here and there. Nothing I couldn't handle. I'm learning so much in just a short amount of time,
                                            and I couldn't be happier.

                 Hi! My name is Frost. Sence you are reading this you must think
                 this will have somthing intresting in it. Sadly the only intesting
                 thing in this entry is that I'm not real, Im just a figment of
                 Nathan's imagination.
               </p>
               <p>
                 I'm just here to complete his challenge for today. That said, I
                 can still make it a little bit more intresting and tell you a
                 story.
               </p>
               <p>
                 So Frost isn't my real name, it's more of a nickname that was
                 bestowed onto me by my town elders. Heres how it went down.
               </p>
               <p>
                 It was the middle of winter and i was six years old at the time.
                 I was doing my daily chore, witch consisted of shoveling snowing
                 snow away from all the doorways in the villige. It didn't help
                 that there was a bizzerd the day before not to mention that we
                 didn't have shovels like the ones that all you have. so to make
                 a long story short by the time I was finnished  my hair and beared
                 was covered with snow and I hand ice growing from my nastals.

           <p>
             If somebody would of told me a week a go that I would be able to
             make a website, I would have told them that I'm a <strong>slow learner</strong>.
             Then I would say, that it would take <em>double</em> that time to even
             think about making a website.
           </p>
           <p>

             looking for somthing that can teach me how to code. Now its having
